Features
--------

- Resizes images on the fly based on predefined user templates.
- Uses the [Intervention image manipulation library](https://github.com/Intervention/image).
- Integrates with Local or remote image stores using the [PHP League Flysystem](http://flysystem.thephpleague.com/) filesystem extraction library.
- Ability to cache processed images so that subsequent requests are served quickly.
- SEO friendly and easy to use URLs i.e. `example.com/<template>/path/to/source/image.png`.
- Supports PNG/JPEG images.

Usage
-----

To start a new project use the composer `create-project` command to install the ImageRack package in a named folder:

```
composer create-project diarmuidie/imagerack <folder-name>
```
Once the package is installed you can edit the contents of:

- `public/index.php` The main file that all requests are handled by.
- `bootstrap/dependencies.local.sample.php` Where the Flysystem and Intervention Image dependencies are configured.
- `templates` Where your templates for resizing media will be stored.

### Configuration
ImageRack allows you to configure the server in a number of ways:

#### Templates
Templates are objects that define how an image should be manipulated. You can create as many of your own templates. Tmeplates must implement the [Diarmuidie\ImageRack\Image\TemplateInterface](https://github.com/diarmuidie/ImageRack-Kernel/blob/master/src/Image/TemplateInterface.php) interface. There is a [sample template](https://github.com/diarmuidie/ImageRack/blob/master/templates/Small.php) provided with ImageRack for resizing images to 320Ã—240px.

After you create a new template it must be registered in the server:

```php
$server->setTemplate(
    'large',
    function () {
        return new Templates\Large();
    }
);
```

#### Not Found Response
You can set an optional "not found" response. By default a 404 header will be sent with the body "File not found". However this can be changed using the `setNotFound()` method:

```php
$server->setNotFound(function ($response) {

    // Edit the response as required
    $response->setContent('Image not found.');

    // Return the new response
    return $response;

});
```

$response is an instance of `Symfony\Component\HttpFoundation\Response`. See the [Symfony HTTP-Foundation docs](http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/http_foundation/introduction.html#response) for more info on what you can do with the response.


### Single Server Setup
A single server deploy is the most straight forward configuration. Source images must be stored in the `storage/source` folder. Resized images will be cached in `storage/cache`.


### Multi-Server Setup
To use the ImageRack server in a multi-server environment (i.e. more than one web servers sitting behind a load ballancer) you must store the source and cache images in a distributed filesystem.

ImageRack comes with a sample configuration for using AWS S3 for this. To use this configuration edit `public/index.php` to load the sample S3 dependencies:

```php
$dependencies = require_once __DIR__.'/../bootstrap/dependencies.s3.sample.php';
```

You will also have to change the `bootstrap/dependencies.s3.sample.php` file to use your S3 Secret and Key and change the bucket names.
